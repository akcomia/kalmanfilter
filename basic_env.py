# Environment Setup
# Objective: Simulate Motion of the Hyperloop Pod
# Key Components: 1) Equation to Simulate true motion of the Hyperloop Pod
#                 2) Equation to model measured Position
#                 3) Physics Based Expected Position and Velocity Equation
# Assumptions: - Sample Measured position with 1m standard deviation
#              - Sample Measured velocity with 0.1km/hr standard deviaation
#              - Constant Accelaration
